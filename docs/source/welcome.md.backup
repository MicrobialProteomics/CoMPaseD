# Welcome to CoMPaseD

CoMPaseD - **Co**mparrison of **M**ultiple **P**rote**ase** **D**igestions

--------------
## Purpose
This is a dummy text explaining that multiple proteases are better than trypsin alone in many cases...

--------------
## Quick Start
CoMPaseD provides both, a command-line interface (CLI), and a graphical user interface (GUI).  
```{note} The following command-line calls might slightly differ depending on you r python setup.
```

#### Commandline Interface (CLI)  
To use the CLI run the `CoMPaseD_CLI.py` command.  
All values for the parameters can be adjusted in the `parameters.params` file.  
Running a full analysis can be done by calling the CLI file together wih the parameter file.  
```bash
python CoMPaseD_CLI.py -p path/to/parameters.params
```
For running individual steps of the tool, use the export (-e), digestion (-d) or result analysis (-a) flags.  
```bash
python CoMPaseD_CLI.py -p path/to/parameter.param [-e] [-d] [-a]
```  
```{note} The [-a] flag requires you to run the rest of the analysis beforehand [-e] and [-d].
```  
For a complete listing of command-line options use the help (-h) flag or refer to the [main documentation](documentation-cli).  
```bash
python CoMPaseD_CLI.py -h
```

#### Graphical User Interface (GUI)  
The GUI can be accessed using `CoMPaseD_gui.py` command.  
```bash
python CoMPaseD_gui.py
```  
```{important} Upon the first program start an error message in the configuration tab indicates errors in the configuration file. 
Adjust the path to the [crux](http://www.crux.ms) executable and save the altered configuration. For subsequent program starts, 
the configuration tab should be skipped and CoMPaseD shows the analysis parameter tab directly.
When the checkbox to use original Perl-based ProteoMapper scripts is checked, paths to these scripts must be selected as well 
and the configuration saved again.
```

## Limitations  
Do not use if you would like to identify an individual protein.  
Simulating real data needs a lot of testing still.
