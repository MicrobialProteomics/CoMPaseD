# CoMPaseD Documentation

The CoMPaseD documentation is available [here]().


## Updating the documentation

The documentation can be easily updated by applying changes to the `docs` folder and pushing them to main (or via pull-request).

For bigger changes it is advisable to first test them locally.

## Locally building the documentation

1. Setup a python environment

```
python -m venv sphinx-env
source sphinx-env/bin/activate
```

2. Install the dependencies

```
pip install -r docs/requirements.txt
```

3. Build the documentation

```
sphinx-build docs/ _build
```

4. Open the webpage by looking at `index.html` found in the `_build` folder.
