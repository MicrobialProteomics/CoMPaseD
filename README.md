   cd C:\Programs\CoMPaseD
   ```

2. **Clone the Repository**  
   Copy the CoMPaseD repository into the chosen directory:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MicrobialProteomics/CoMPaseD.git
   ```

3. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**  
   Set up a virtual environment to manage dependencies:
   ```bash
   C:\Programs\Python\python.exe -m venv venv
   C:\Programs\CoMPaseD\venv\Scripts\activate.bat
   ```

4. **Install Dependencies**
